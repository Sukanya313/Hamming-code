Hamming code is an encrption scheme that help detect and correct one bit errors.
Client can send one message at a time.
To show the implementation of hamming encryption and decryption, client has an option of sending the message error free or sending it with
a 1 bit error, in which case the server will correct that error while receiving the message and indicate which bit position had the error.
